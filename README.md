## Subjects
- Learning C
  - Working with Structs
  - Dynamic lists
    - Library Project 
    - School Daily Project
  - Files and I/O Stream
    - Context Decoder Project
    - Notepad Project

## Learning C

### Step 1: Working with Structs
First we learn about structs and how to write a program with functional programming.<br />
Learn them by reading these two perfect sources:
- [Programiz](https://www.programiz.com/c-programming/c-structures)
- [Geeks for Geeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/structures-c/)

After that create a simple project called **Library System**.<br />
Library system project features:
- Fixed size array of Books (use struct)
  - Each book has: Author - Content - Date 
- Adding books and removing books
- Search for a book

### Step 2: Dynamic lists
On this step we are going to implement a linkedlist in C programming language, to learn about pointers.<br />
Read about pointer to structs in the link below:<br />
 - [Programiz](https://www.programiz.com/c-programming/c-structures-pointers)

After that create a simple linkedlist with the following fields and features:
- Fields
  - int data
  - char status
  - string code
- Features
  - Insert at any index
  - Remove any index (remove by code)
  - Search by code 
  - Reverse order

After that we upgrade our **Library System** from fixed size list to a dynamic list.<br />
For our last work we implement a daily student status of an school project:
- List of days
  - Each day has a list of present studets
  - And a list for absent studets
- Add a new day
  - Modify the day lists
- Get a day students
